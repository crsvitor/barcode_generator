# Folders Structure

This aims to help understand the used folder structure. There are:

- Controllers: gathers business logic.

- Drivers: gathers dependencies logic.

- Main: gathers server logic.
    - Routes: gathers route logic.
    - Server: gathers server lib declaration.

- Views: gathers http handling logic.

There is a design pattern called Facade, which can relate with this structure.
